You've found me! Welcome to my personal blog: [www.thucldnguyen.com](https://www.thucldnguyen.com)! 

My name is **Thuc Nguyen** - a Senior Product Manager at [Axon](https://www.axon.com). I'm a proud dad of two: Mira is 2 years young and Mino is a newborn. If you want to know more about me, read on. 

I grew up in Vietnam ‚Äî a war-torn country where most kids had never even seen a computer, let alone owned one. My dad was a tradditional medicine practitioner who had to retire young due to his disabilities. My mom ‚Äî a nurse with an iron will and a soft heart ‚Äî carried the family of four on her modest salary.

We couldn‚Äôt afford luxuries, so in my 6th grade when my mom‚Äôs friend gifted us her old Intel 80386 computer, it felt like Christmas, Lunar New Year, and a lottery win all rolled into one. To put things in perspective, that machine cost roughly 3.6 ounces of gold ‚Äî enough to buy half a hectare (1.2 acres) of rice paddy in Vietnam back in the 1990s. But to me, it was worth infinitely more. It was my window into a new world of technology and wonders.

I still remember fumbling with the QWERTY keyboard, typing DOS commands and watching the screen respond like magic. I played a few pixelated games, most notably [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)). While I was mastering DOS, my dad installed Windows 3.1 for me, and I discovered my love for digital art through CorelDraw. Before long, curiosity turned into obsession.

By middle school, I was spending hours learning Pascal everyday and building little programs ‚Äî including a fully functional [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) game with a graphical UI on MS DOS. That was my ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment: realizing I could create something interesting out of thin air with just logic, if-else statements, For loops, and a flicker of imagination.

That passion earned me a spot in an honors class dedicated to competitive programming from 7th to 12th grade. I competed in numerous contests ‚Äî sometimes winning, sometimes losing, but always learning. My proudest (and most nerve-wracking) moment came in 9th grade when I won first prize in a city-wide programming contest in Ho Chi Minh City ‚Äî a city of over ten million people and hundreds of thousdands of kids my age. 

What most people didn‚Äôt know was that I had almost lost everything. I was so focused on the recursive problem, I forgot to hit save halfway through the contest. My floppy disk failed unexpectedly multiple times, and I had to rewrite my code under brutal time pressure. I submitted my work not even sure if it was saved correctly. When the results came weeks later, I was stunned: I‚Äôd actually won a gold medal.

Programming wasn‚Äôt just a hobby ‚Äî it was a lifeline. I knew it could pull my family out of poverty and open doors to a better future. My parents, especially my mom, encouraged me every step of the way. From her, I learned grit, empathy, and the power of lifelong learning. (At 64, she speaks French and English fluently but is still improving her French and English)

I joined L√™ H·ªìng Phong ‚Äî one of the most prestigious high schools in Vietnam, also in an honors class specializing in programming. Graduating from high school, it was a no-brainer to pursue Computer Science in university. Thanks to my background in competitive programming, I passed college programming courses with flying colors and earned my Computer Science degree from Hoa Sen University as valedictorian.

By 2010s, I stepped into the professional world at a boutique Silicon Valley firm called LogiGear. My first role was as a Business Analyst ‚Äî a fancy title that, at the time, mostly meant ‚Äúwrite product specs and hope they make sense.‚Äù I gradually climbed the ranks to Associate Product Manager, then Product Manager for a test automation platform called TestArchitect. It was a scrappy, hands-on environment where I learned the craft of product management from the ground up: asking the five whys, thinking critically, and structuring every decision with a 1:3:1 approach ‚Äî one problem, three options, one chosen solution.

We were also among the first Microsoft partners to release a Visual Studio automation extension ‚Äî TestArchitect for Visual Studio (TA4VS) ‚Äî that made .NET testing a breeze. Around that time, I spent nearly two years in the U.S. (2016‚Äì2017), leading content marketing for our product and writing blog posts for LogiGear‚Äôs own blog and testing communities like TechWell. My mentor, Do Nguyen, taught me how to think strategically, roadmap like a pro, and tell a story through content. Those lessons shaped my product DNA for years to come.

LogiGear was where I met my beautiful soulmate - Xuyen. We spent our honeymoon in Europe, right before the COVID breakout. Four weeks after we left Milan, Italy closed its borders and imposed its very first shelter-in-place quarantine. It was a close call and we were lucky to say the least!

![Honey Moon](/assets/honey-moon-collage.png "Honey moon")

After nearly a decade at LogiGear, I joined Axon, the tech company best known for the TASER ‚Äî yes, that TASER. My first product was Axon Performance, a tool that helps police agencies track and improve how officers use TASERs, body cameras and in-car cameras through AI-powered video audits conducted by their supervisors. When I joined, Axon Performance had around 11,000 adopted users. Two years later, we crossed 110,000 ‚Äî a 10X growth. 

I launched multiple product initiatives that customers loved like the TASER Dashboard, the Fleet3 Dashboard, the Weekly Compliance Report, and Priority-Ranked Video Audits all designed to help agencies ensure accountability and performance. Today, over 1,500 police departments rely on Axon Performance to make data-driven decisions that ultimately lead to safer outcomes for both officers and communities.

Now, I‚Äôm the Product Manager for one of Axon‚Äôs bread-and-butter features: video streaming and playback on Evidence.com. It‚Äôs where officers and investigators review digital evidence every day. We‚Äôve cut streaming latency in half, reduced rebuffering, and completely revamped the review workflow. It‚Äôs not just a feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs the beating heart of our platform. With around 450,000 monthly active users, it‚Äôs humbling to think that nearly half of all officers in the U.S. interact with something my team built.

Working with law enforcement has given me a unique perspective. I‚Äôve ridden along with departments like San Jose PD, Tucson PD, and Dallas PD. Those ride-alongs taught me how tough police work really is ‚Äî and how much potential technology has to make it safer and smarter. I remember one officer in Bothell PD manually typing every license plate to check for hotlists ‚Äî a process that could‚Äôve been automated in seconds via [Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)](https://my.axon.com/s/article/FAQs-ALPR?language=en_US). That‚Äôs the kind of inefficiency I want to fix.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm first and foremost a dad. My two kids ‚Äî Mira is a 2-yo toddler and Mino is a newborn ‚Äî are my world. Parenthood teaches me more about empathy, patience, and leadership than any management course ever could.

When I‚Äôm not chasing deadlines (or my kids), you‚Äôll probably find me cycling, at the gym, or practicing Muay Thai. I actually have a black belt in Taekwondo ‚Äî earned after 5 years of practice back in school. Martial arts taught me discipline, humility, and the beauty of incremental progress ‚Äî which ties closely to one of my favorite principles: the 1% rule. If you can get just 1% better every day, those small improvements compound into a result of 37 times better over 365 days.

That‚Äôs how I try to live ‚Äî constantly learning, iterating, and improving. Whether it‚Äôs tech, product strategy, or investing, I‚Äôm always chasing that next 1%.

So that‚Äôs me ‚Äî a kid from Vietnam who fell in love with an old computer, grew up to build products used by hundreds of thousands of people, and still gets excited by every new line of code and every ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment from a customer.

If you‚Äôre building something meaningful ‚Äî something that empowers people, connects communities, or just makes life a little better ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

üëâ Drop me a note or find me on LinkedIn. I‚Äôm always up for a good conversation about product, tech, or how to make the world 1% better.
