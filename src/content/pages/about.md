Thank you for visting [www.thucldnguyen.com](https://www.thucldnguyen.com)! It's a blog about Automated Testing and Product Management.

I love software testing, especially Automated testing. That’s why you’ll find this blog full of pieces about this topic. Hopefully a passionate tester could find quality contents here to enrich testing knowledge that helps conquer more complex testing challenges.

I also read for fun. My favorite reading topics include Technology, Business, Psychology, History, Philosophy, Startup, Growth Hacking, and especially Product Management.

As a writer, I sometimes guest-blogged here and there. So I’ve collected all the bits and pieces I wrote (mostly about software testing) on this blog. Check them out.
