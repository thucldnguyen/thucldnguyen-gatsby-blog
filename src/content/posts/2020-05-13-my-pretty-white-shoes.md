There are several interesting web app automation scenarios that we can improve using AI:

* **Increase test execution stability (self-healing automation)** by letting AI to automatically locate web elements when the primary locators fail. This feature already appears in some cutting-edge automation tools like [Mabl](http://mabl.com/).
* **Increase automation productivity** by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically translate manual test cases into automated test cases. In theory, this capability should be feasible but I havenâ€™t seen any open-source or commercial solutions available on the market yet.
* **Increase test coverage** by auto-generate input parameters that could exhaustively test the API under test using advanced algorithms such as [Pairwise](https://www.logigear.com/magazine/API-testing/pairwise-api-testing-ci-cd-friendly-model-based-automation/).
* **Reduce test execution time** by only running the tests that are impacted by a certain code commit instead of exhaustively running all of them after every code commit. For instance, check out the [Test Impact Analysis feature of Microsoft Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/test-impact-analysis?view=azure-devops).
* **Reduce failure debugging time** by auto analyzing test results and assigning them to categories like Environment Issues, Automation Problems, App Defects, etc. An outstanding example of this category is [Report Portal](http://reportportal.io/).
* **Perform visual validations** on web apps using OCR or image-recognition techniques. There are plenty of tools out there such as [TestArchitect](http://testarchitect.com/), [AppliTools](http://applitools.com/) and [SikuliX](http://sikulix.com/).
