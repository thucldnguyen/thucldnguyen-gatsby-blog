Thank you for visting [www.thucldnguyen.com](https://www.thucldnguyen.com) -- a blog about Test Automation and Product Management! 

I love software testing, especially automation testing. That’s why you’ll find this website littered with posts about automation testing. Hopefully passionate testers would find practical contents here to improve their testing skills and conquer more complex testing challenges .

Besides my 9-5 job at a testing center in Vietnam, I read for fun. My favorite reading topics include technology, psychology, history, philosophy, startup, growth hacking, product management, and many more. In my free time, I tinker with new technologies or mingle with my pals over a bottle of beer.

I’m also a content creator. I’ve collected all the bits and pieces I wrote  (mostly about software testing) below. Check them out. Besides these posts, you’ll find more of me in the Blog corner of this page.
