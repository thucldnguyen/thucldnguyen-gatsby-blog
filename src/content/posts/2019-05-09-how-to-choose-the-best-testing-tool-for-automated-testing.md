The process of choosing the best automation tool for a test project is not always straightforward. Thus, in this article I’d like to shed some more light on it. 

1. **Define a list of criteria** that your ideal Test Automation framework should meet such as *supported automation platforms (desktop, web or mobile?), usability, maintainability, stability, ease of debugging test failures, ease of integrating test automation into a CI/CD pipeline, first-class Docker support, budget/pricing, etc.*
2. **Weigh the criteria** you selected. Which criteria are more desirable and which annoying problems you can live with in the long run? 
3. **Look around** (especially for tool listing articles), and pick at least 3 good Test Automation frameworks that closely match your criteria considering your current situation.
4. **Try** building a workable framework if you picked open-source solutions like [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/), [Protractor](http://protractortest.org/), [Cypress](http://cypress.io/), etc. or ask for a demo if you‘re evaluating commercial solutions like [UFT](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/unified-functional-automated-testing/overview), [TestComplete](https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/), [TestArchitect](https://www.testarchitect.com/), [Ranorex](http://ranorex.com/), etc. When you’re at it, pay special attention to the criteria you already listed out. Some call this stage a POC (Proof of Concept). 
5. **Rate** each tool on the scale from 1 to 10 for every criterion you selected. Then compute the score of each tool considering the weight of each criterion. Make sure you’re being fair and your rankings are transitive (if **toolX** > **toolY** and **toolY** > **toolZ**, **toolX** must be superior to **toolZ**).
6. Voila! **Pick the best tool** that got the highest score. No brainer!

If you like Selenium and look for Selenium alternatives, check out this article: [Best Alternatives to Selenium WebDriver](/blog/web-automation-testing/best-alternatives-to-selenium/). Hopefully, this weighted-decision method can help you pick the best software testing tool for automated testing. Feel free to leave a comment below.
